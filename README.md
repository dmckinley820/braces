Braces
===========

Braces is a starter theme that is meant for getting development teams up and running on WordPress projects quickly. Braces is derived from [Automattic _s project] (https://github.com/Automattic/_s). _s is truly a fantastic project and much of the core beliefs behind _s will land in this project as well.

However, we did deviate a bit in a way that suited our business needs and hopefully you find it helpful as well. Some of the main features you can find in addition are [Sass] (http://sass-lang.com) intergration, file and structure clean up, and most noticeably, the PHP syntax. Typically any new additions should have readme docs for their explanations.

Pull requests are welcome!

Why Braces?
---------------

Braces alters the typical WP PHP loop syntax for a more [PHP coding standards] (http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/) approach using more, well, "braces".

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to set things up manually, download `braces` from github. The first thing you want to do is copy the `braces` directory and change the name to something else - Like, say, `megatherium` - then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

* Search for: `* @author Oomph, Inc.` and replace with: `* @author { Your Company }`
* Search for: `* @link http://www.oomphinc.com` and replace with: `* @link { Your URL }`
* Search for: `braces` and replace with: `megatherium`

Dont forget to update the core style.css with you own information.
Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
